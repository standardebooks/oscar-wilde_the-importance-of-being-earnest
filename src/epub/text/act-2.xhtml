			<p>Scene: Garden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the house. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year, July. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a large yew-tree.</p>

You would no doubt wish me to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction"><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Jack</b> presses his hand convulsively.</i> My sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">All sigh.</i> I have preached it at harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of humiliation and festal days. The last time I delivered it was in the Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the Prevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders. The Bishop, who was present, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.</td>
